###### Disclaimer
You would most likely have to be googeling a bit to solve many of these tasks. In fact, we encourage you to. We'll be strolling around, happy to answer any questions you may have! :)

We decided to have the set of tasks written in English, since we know some of you are international students.

### Oppgave 1a

Change the application so that it generates a new svada sentence when the application launches

Hint: change the viewDidLoad method in the ViewController class

### Oppgave 1b

Change the text color and text size of the svada generator

Hint: Take a look at the storyboard file and do it graphically, or look up UIColor and UIFont and the properties of a label in Swift

### Oppgave 2a 

Change the background color of the application

Hint: This can be done graphically or in code. But more fun to do in code.
Look up the properties of UIView.

### Oppgave 2b

Change the app from the previous state of Oppgave 2a so that the background changes to a random color each time the button is clicked.

Hint: Take a look at the UIColor class, arrays and the arc4random function



### Oppgave 4 (could be difficult for complete beginners)

Change the application so that when the user exits and enter the app again, a new svada sentence is generated

Hint: Have a variable in your AppDelegate class that refers to the ViewController instance
